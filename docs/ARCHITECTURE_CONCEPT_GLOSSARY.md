| DDD | Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain. | [Article by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html)
| Onion Architecture | Onion Architecture was introduced by Jeffrey Palermo to provide a better way to build applications in perspective of better testability, maintainability, and dependability. Onion Architecture addresses the challenges faced with 3-tier and n-tier architectures, and to provide a solution for common problems. Onion architecture layers interact to each other by using the Interfaces. | [Understanding Onion Architecture](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/csharp/cs_misc/designtechniques/understanding-onion-architecture.html)
| Hexagonal architecture | The hexagonal architecture, or ports and adapters architecture, is an architectural pattern used in software design. It aims at creating loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment by means of ports and adapters. This makes components exchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation. | [Netflix experience](https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749) |
