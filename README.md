# DDD Rest API

**WIP**
I just got tired of having to bootstrap projects from scratch. Most of the time Rest APIs have similar needs, so I decided to create a template that have most common tools needed in a REST API.

## Architecture

This template is built using DDD concepts, as well as Onion Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture.
